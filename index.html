          Out of the night that covers me <br>
          Black as the pit from poll to poll <br>
          I thank whatever gods may be <br>
           for my unconquerable soul <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the fell clutch of circumstance <br />
          I have not winced nor cried aloud <br>
          Under the bludgeoning of chance <br>
          My head is bloody but unbowed <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Out of this place of wrath and tears <br>
          Looms but the horror of the shade <br>
          And yet the menace of the years <br>
          Finds and shall find me unafraid <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          It matters not how strait the gate <br>
          How charged with punishments the scroll <br>
          I am the master of my fate <br>
          I am the captain of my soul <br>
        </p>
